# How to Ask For Help

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ This resource will explain how best to utilize your independent learning time. It will provide some insight into common concerns when stuck, blocked, or confused during a lesson or lab.

# During Lessons

**Questions about a lesson**:

- Occasionally your instructor will ask you to answer questions in the slack channel: `seir-1016-ec-classroom`
- However, most debugging questions should be posted to this slack channel: `seir-1016-ec-debugging`
- During session lectures, please feel free to unmute and *"interrupt"* if you have a question that has not been answered, after a short time. Instructors may not see "raised hands" during remote instruction.

## Using the `debug` channel

### **Questions about your code**:

Please make a *descriptive* post about your issue in the debugging channel:

- include in it the relevant code snippet (use the Slack code snippet feature)
- provide some context around it and the specific error you are receiving
- screen captures of the error can help with larger error â€˜stacksâ€™

# Seeking Help During Labs

### Consider the following questions before asking for help:

- What is your understanding of the error you're receiving? What clue does the error give you as to how to solve it?
- Did you look up the error in order to get a better understanding of what it means?
- What have you tried to do in order to remedy the problem?
- What lesson or outside sources have you referenced?

If you cannot answer these questions, the instructors may ask you to investigate these angles before providing 1:1 support.

# The Problem Solving Process

### Breath & Assess

- Sit with the problem
- Draw it out (literally) - create a diagram of each step of the process you are trying to work through
- â€˜rubber duckâ€™ - talk it out so you can better understand the problem
- **Work on this for 10-15 minutes**

### **Review your code line-by-line**

- Check with a peer & review your code. Trying to explain your problem to another person might help clarify the issue.
- **Work on this for 10 minutes**

### **Check your notes**

- Brainstorm with a fellow dev about an in-class/notion examples to provide a guide.
- **Work on this for 10-15 minutes**

### **Confirm**

- Post in the â€˜debuggingâ€™ channel :
- Highlight your goal / problem
- List what you have tried and the current error messages you are receiving (screen caps are great!)
- I**f you receive no response after 20 minutes @ your pod leader.**

### **Pivot:**

- Move on to the next problem / area of your project if you are blocked in one area. Styling, readme documentation, commenting your code are great ways to keep busy when you are blocked.

### **Circle Back**

- Send a DM to your IA/IL for **60-90 minutes of being blocked** on a problem.
